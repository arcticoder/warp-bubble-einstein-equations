# warp-bubble-einstein-equations

This repository generates the Einstein tensor \(G_{\mu\nu}\) and the corresponding stressâ€“energy tensor \(T_{\mu\nu}\) for a warp-bubble metric ansatz. It relies on the connection and curvature definitions produced by the **warp-bubble-connection-curvature** repo.

## Contents

- **einstein_equations.py**  
  - Downloads and parses `connection_curvature.tex`  
  - Reconstructs the metric \(g_{\mu\nu}\), Ricci tensor \(R_{\mu\nu}\), and scalar curvature \(R\)  
  - Computes
    \[
      G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \tfrac{1}{2}\,g_{\mu\nu}\,R,\quad
      T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{8\pi}\,G_{\mu\nu}
    \]
  - Exports each \(T_{\mu\nu}\) component to LaTeX in **stress_energy.tex**

- **stress_energy.tex**  
  A standalone LaTeX document showing
  \[
    G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi\,T_{\mu\nu}
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    T_{\mu\nu}(x) = \frac{1}{8\pi}G_{\mu\nu}(x)
    = \begin{pmatrix}
      T_{00} & T_{01} & \cdots \\
      \vdots & \ddots & 
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  with all entries filled in.

```


## Scope, Validation & Limitations

- Scope: The materials and numeric outputs in this repository are research-stage examples and depend on implementation choices, parameter settings, and numerical tolerances.
- Validation: Reproducibility artifacts (scripts, raw outputs, seeds, and environment details) are provided in `docs/` or `examples/` where available; reproduce analyses with parameter sweeps and independent environments to assess robustness.
- Limitations: Results are sensitive to modeling choices and discretization. Independent verification, sensitivity analyses, and peer review are recommended before using these results for engineering or policy decisions.
